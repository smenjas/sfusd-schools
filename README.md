# SFUSD Schools

Compare the many public schools in the [San Francisco Unified School District
(SFUSD)](https://www.sfusd.edu/). You should also [tour nearby
schools](https://sfusd.edu/tours) and talk to other caregivers and educators
about what works best for your child.

SFUSD did not create, and is not affiliated with this web app. It is made by a
parent, for parents and caregivers of current and prospective SFUSD students.
