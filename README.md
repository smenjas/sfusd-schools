# SFUSD Schools

The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) consists of many public
schools, and choosing one for your child can be a challenge. This app helps
parents compare schools based on quantitative measures. These measures are not
sufficient to compare schools: parents should tour nearby schools and discuss
criteria with their partners, other parents, and educators to arrive at a
nuanced understanding of what will work for their children.
