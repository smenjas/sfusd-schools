<h1>SFUSD Schools</h1>

<p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) consists of many public
schools, and choosing one for your child can be a challenge. This app helps
parents compare schools based on quantitative measures. These measures are not
sufficient to compare schools: parents and guardians should tour nearby schools
and discuss criteria with their partners, other parents, and educators to
arrive at a nuanced understanding of what will work for their children.</p>
